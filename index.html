This striking discrepancy underscores the immense significance of addressing Cardiovascular Disease as a critical global health challenge.
      <br><br>
      Cardiovascular Disease, which encompasses conditions like heart disease and stroke, remains a pervasive threat to populations around the world. Factors such as sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits, and tobacco use contribute to its prevalence.
